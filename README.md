# ASNN
# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- `@vitejs/plugin-react` uses Babel for Fast Refresh
- `@vitejs/plugin-react-swc` uses SWC for Fast Refresh

## Setup

To get started:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/react-vite-setup.git
cd react-vite-setup
npm install
npm run dev
